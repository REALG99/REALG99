<h1>Drawdown Management Strategy</h1>

<p>Drawdowns are inevitable in probabilistic systems like financial markets. The key distinction between professional traders and failing participants lies in drawdown control rather than win-rate optimization.</p>

<h2>Understanding Drawdown Cycles</h2>

<p>Every trading strategy contains variance. Losing streaks are statistical events, not necessarily structural failures. Overreaction during drawdowns amplifies capital destruction.</p>

<h2>Capital Preservation Protocol</h2>

<p>Reducing position size after consecutive losses is a core risk discipline mechanism. Adaptive exposure limits prevent emotional escalation.</p>

<h2>Psychological Stability Under Loss</h2>

<p>Drawdowns trigger fear-based decisions. Structured rules eliminate impulsive recovery attempts and protect long-term equity curves.</p>

<h2>Recovery Mathematics</h2>

<p>Large losses require disproportionately large gains to recover. Controlled exposure reduces recovery burden and stabilizes long-term growth.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Drawdown management is the core of survival. Traders who prioritize capital defense remain in the game long enough to benefit from favorable cycles.</p>
