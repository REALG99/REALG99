  <p>This short quiz analyzes your risk tolerance and behavior under volatility.</p>
  <h2>Why Trading Psychology Matters</h2>

<p>Most traders focus only on strategy, indicators, and market timing. However, long-term performance is often determined by psychological stability and risk management discipline rather than technical tools alone.</p>

<p>Understanding how you react to volatility, drawdowns, and uncertainty can reveal structural strengths and weaknesses in your trading behavior. Emotional overreaction, revenge trading, and poor risk allocation are among the most common causes of capital erosion.</p>

<p>This quiz is designed to highlight behavioral tendencies rather than predict profits. The goal is self-awareness — identifying whether you naturally lean toward long-term stability, balanced swing positioning, or high-frequency decision-making under pressure.</p>

<p>Improving trading results often begins with recognizing personal bias. A structured approach to risk and emotional control can significantly increase survival probability in volatile markets.</p>
